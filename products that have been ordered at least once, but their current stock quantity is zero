Problem:
Retrieve all products that have been ordered at least once, but their current stock quantity is zero. Display the product name, brand name, and the current stock quantity.

SQL Query:
SELECT
    p.product_name,
    b.brand_name,
    s.quantity AS current_stock_quantity
FROM
    production.products AS p
JOIN
    production.brands AS b ON p.brand_id = b.brand_id
JOIN
    production.stocks AS s ON p.product_id = s.product_id
WHERE
    EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM sales.order_items AS oi
        JOIN sales.orders AS o ON oi.order_id = o.order_id
        WHERE oi.product_id = p.product_id
    )
    AND s.quantity = 0;
